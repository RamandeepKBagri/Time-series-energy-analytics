# Time-series-energy-analytics
This project is done for completion of 320 course (Golden Gate University).
In this project, we will discuss the description of the data and time series analysis using PJM company data. The project aims to explore the load in MW (Megawatt) in different areas in the United States and their forecasting. This report will also review the use of the type of fuel used for generating electricity. Finally, I used critical thinking to conclude the energy analysis with some interesting trends using Python.
